# Student-Performance-Analysis

## 📌 Introduction
This project explores the relationship between various factors (attendance, homework completion, study hours, motivation, etc.) and student exam performance.  
The goal was to identify which factors most strongly influence exam scores and present the findings through visualizations and reports.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods
- **Excel**: Initial data exploration and cleaning.  
- **Power Query**: Handled duplicates, missing values, and category standardization.  
- **Pivot Tables**: Early aggregations to spot initial trends.  
- **Tableau**: Built interactive dashboards and visual analysis.  
- **Power BI**: Used to validate results with additional visualizations.  

## 📊 Results
- Unfortunately, the dataset used in this project did not yield clear or significant results.
- From the Excel pivot table analysis, there was no strong relationship observed between homework completion and exam scores.
- Similarly, Tableau & Power BI visualizations showed only minimal differences.
