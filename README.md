# Student-Performance-Analysis

## 📌 Introduction
This project explores the relationship between various factors (attendance, homework completion, study hours, motivation, etc.) and student exam performance.  
The goal was to identify which factors most strongly influence exam scores and present the findings through visualizations and reports.

## 🛠️ Tools & Methods
- **Excel**: Initial data exploration and cleaning.  
- **Power Query**: Handled duplicates, missing values, and category standardization.  
- **Pivot Tables**: Early aggregations to spot initial trends.  
- **Tableau**: Built interactive dashboards and visual analysis.  
- **Power BI**: Used to validate results with additional visualizations.  

## 📊 Results
- Homework completion and study hours are strong predictors of exam success.  
- Attendance status had little direct correlation with scores.  
- Parental involvement and teacher quality had minor positive effects.
